			<h2>"Shiver Thy Timbers" Sets Sail into Full Production! 🏴‍☠️⚓</h2>
			<p>
				<br>
				Ahoy, adventurers and landlubbers alike! We have thrilling news from the high seas: Shiver Thy Timbers has officially exited preproduction and entered full production!
				<br><br>
				After months of meticulous planning, concept development, and early design, the ship is ready to sail into the next exciting phase. During preproduction, our team worked tirelessly to lay a solid foundation—crafting the core mechanics, perfecting the art direction worthy of the most daring pirates. 
				<br><br>
				What Does This Mean?
				<br>
				Entering production means we’re now fully focused on:
				Developing Gameplay: Bringing our pirate-themed mechanics to (after)life, from haunting traps to ghostly abilities.
				Creating Art and Audio: Finalizing the visuals and soundscapes that will transport you into the spooky mindset.
				<br><br>
				We’re incredibly excited to see Shiver Thy Timbers evolve from concept to reality, and we can’t wait to share more updates with you along the way. Stay tuned for sneak peeks, development diaries, and a few surprises as we chart this thrilling new course.
				<br><br>
				Thank you for your continued support and enthusiasm. The seas are calling, and adventure awaits! 🌊
				<br><br>
				Until next time,
				CAP🏴‍☠️

			<h2>Meet Scary Mary: The Ghostly Terror of the High Seas! 👻🏴‍☠️</h2>
			<p>
				Who’s that lurking in the shadows of the pirate ship? Who whispers chilling secrets through the creaking boards and sends shivers down the spines of even the bravest buccaneers? It’s none other than Scary Mary, the haunting heart of Shiver Thy Timbers! 💀⚓
				<br><br>
				A Ghost with a Grudge
				<br>
				Once an innocent soul wronged by ruthless pirates, Scary Mary now haunts the very ship that took everything from her. But don’t mistake her for a helpless spirit—she’s out for revenge, and her spectral powers make her a force to be reckoned with.
				<br><br>
				Mary is no ordinary ghost. With a heart broken and a spirit split between the world of the living and the dead, she’s determined to scare every last pirate into oblivion. Traps, terror, and twisted tricks are her weapons, and no scallywag is safe from her wrath!
				<br><br>
				Are you ready to become the terror of the high seas? In Shiver Thy Timbers, it’s time for Scary Mary to turn fear into her ultimate weapon. Prepare to haunt, frighten, and shiver thy timbers! 🌊
				<br><br>
				Stay tuned for more updates, and remember… revenge is sweet, but fear is sweeter. 👀
				<br><br>
				Until net time,
				CAP🏴‍☠️
